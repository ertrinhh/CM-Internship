# CM-Internship
## Work / Project Examples
Provide up to three examples of work/projects that youâ€™ve recently participated in and provide detailed information about your role and contributions to the project.
### Mixr Cocktail generator 
- [Deployed site](https://cocktail-generator-262-final.herokuapp.com/)
- [Source code](https://github.com/gvitaly87/Cocktail-Generator)
- Mixr is cocktail generator website that allows people to view new recipes, generate random cocktails, with a login/subscribe feature 
- In this project, I was on the front-end design side. I was primarily focused on designing mockups for the project, color scheme, fonts, and coding the front-end portion of the project. This consisted of coding the html/css of the home, recipe, error, and team page, and designing the logo and svg's on Illustrtor. In order to avoid merge conflicts, we did a lot of pair coding because having 2 eyes on the code being written was extremely helpful when finding errors. Once the main pages were up, I was in charge of refactoring the files into ejs/mjs files. 

### HubSuite Website 
- [Deployed site](https://hubsuite.herokuapp.com/)
- HubSuite is a website that aims to bring the tech communities together. It allows users to filter and find new tech groups that align with their interests, new and upcoming events and networking opportunities. 
- This project is still a WIP. I am currently volunteering with the Calgary UX group, and I was put on this project as a designer and developer. The main compoents of this website was built using React with components from Material-UI. From the UX side, I worked with the team to develop user personas, pain points, user flows, areas of improvement, information architecture. Once the design components are finalizized, I will be working with the dev team to build upon the existing website. 

### Vegan Street Website Redesign
- [Deployed site](https://veganstreet.ca/)
- [Old website](https://www.veganstreeteats.ca/)
- For our final project at SAIT, my group connected with the owners of Vegan Street to do a redesign of their entire website. They are opening a new location in the upcoming weeks and wanted to showcase that in their new website. 
- For this project, I was in charge of creating a new branding and color scheme for both locations. After approval of colors and branding, I was able to create mockups on Figma to demonstrate the user flow and overall story being told by the website. Once mockups were approved, I was able to make their custom 4-page website come to life on WordPress. I was also in charge of tablet/mobile responsive testing and overall usability. 
 
## Inspiration
Provide up to three examples of work that has recently inspired you from a technical perspective. These can be open source projects, CodePens/CodeSandboxes, blog posts, etc. Be sure to include specifics on what you found inspiring.
- [UX Design Challenges](https://uxtools.co/challenges)
  - This website is a great way to challenge your thinking process to really help you understand design. Once I was able to learn about the technical side of design, I was able to look at my projects with another eye, and found it so inspiring to want to recreate my projects to make it even better. I think being able to understand design concepts is a amazing way to help you become a better developer. As you see your project come to life from both aspects of design and development, you learn to appreciate the small design changes that really help your projects go from good to professional. 

- [Airbnb Javascript Library](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
  - This repo helped guide me in my JavaScript journey. There is so much to learn, and it's extremely inspiring to see other developers putting together repo's like this to help newer developers. This is a more approachable way to start JavaScript, and it is much less intimidating so you are exited and inspired to create new projects. Even if your projects are small, in my mind it is still a huge accomplishment. 

- The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman
  - I think everyone should read this book becayse it will inspire you to re-think what design truly is. Before reading this, I never really thought about the interactions of the things I create. I thought hey, a button is a button right? But after reading this, you start to think about the why the button is here, and what it's purpose is. Being able to think about small details like this allowed me to simplify my projects, and turn made my projects run faster because I really did not need all of those fancy animations. 
 
## Focus
If you were given the time and resources to build/learn anything you wanted during your internship, where would you choose to focus your efforts? Provide a brief description of how you would spend your time.
- I would love to be a developer who is a part of the design implementation process. Being able to bridge that gap between designers and developers is something I've been interested in doing. Designing an application, and being able to understand how to code it would be what I would focus on. Some would call that the front-front-end Developer haha.
